       - Target audiences already addressed (e.g., children, adults, beginners)
       - Angles and perspectives already explored
       MANDATORY REQUIREMENT: Generate ideas that are DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from existing content.
       SIMILARITY CHECK: Each new idea must pass this test:
       - Does it cover a completely different aspect of the topic?
       - Does it target a different audience or use case?
       - Does it approach the subject from a unique angle?
       - Would someone search for this using different keywords than existing content?
       If any idea feels similar to existing content, REJECT it and create a genuinely different alternative.
    3. TOPIC RESEARCH: Research "{topic}" using available data (search trends, competitor analysis, keyword tools).
    4. CURRENT TRENDS ANALYSIS: Consider what's trending and relevant regarding "{topic}" as of {current_date} to ensure ideas feel fresh and current.

       - Are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from existing content in {existing_articles}
       - Explore unexplored angles, audiences, or aspects of the topic
    6. DIFFERENTIATION VALIDATION: For each generated idea, explicitly verify:
       - How it differs from existing content
       - What unique value it provides
       - Why it fills a gap not covered by existing articles
    7. RATIONALE: Provide 1-2 sentences explaining why each idea is valuable for users AND good for SEO, plus confirmation that it's distinct from existing content.
    8. QUALITY: Ensure ideas are well-articulated, business-relevant, and easy to read (no fluff).

    DEPENDENCY: This task MUST receive the complete output from the Brand Voice & Style Specialist (style_task) which contains both "### **Final Post Title**" and "### **Final Styled Blog Post**" sections.
    1. IMPORTANT: Look for the section marked "### **Final Post Title**" in the Brand Voice & Style Specialist output and extract the title that comes immediately after it. This is the exact title you must translate.
    2. Take the "Final Post Title" and "Final Styled Blog Post" and translate them into all those languages {language_list}, one by one.
    3. Your translation must be natural, fluent, and culturally adapted to each language — it must read like it was originally written by a native SEO copywriter.
    4. Translate the title and content separately:
       - MANDATORY: Extract the exact title that appears after "### **Final Post Title**" in the previous agent's output
       - Translate this extracted "Final Post Title" for the <title> tag
       - Translate the "Final Styled Blog Post" content for the <body> tag
       - Do NOT include the title again in the body content
    5. Preserve the structure and tags of the original HTML (e.g., <h2>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <strong>, etc.) — do not remove or alter the structure, but translate everything
    6. Carefully translate key SEO elements: titles, headings, keywords, lists, and emphasized terms. Maintain SEO integrity (including keyword usage, subheadings, and readability).
    7. CONTENT FRESHNESS: Ensure all translations maintain the sense of currency and freshness from the original content, preserving references to {current_date} and keeping all information feeling current and up-to-date.
    8. CRITICAL TRANSLATION RULE: Translate ALL text content including keywords and phrases inside HTML tags like <strong>, <em>, <b>, etc. 
       For example: "<strong>best singing teacher Zurich</strong>" in French should become "<strong>meilleur professeur de chant Zurich</strong>"
       ZERO text should remain in the original language - everything must be naturally translated to the target language.
    9. MANDATORY WORD-BY-WORD VALIDATION: After translating, perform these verification steps:
       - Scan the entire text for common untranslated English words: "for", "female", "school", "online", "mix", "live", "best", "top", "guide", "how", "what", "when", "where", "why", "and", "or", "but", "with", "from", "to", "in", "on", "at", "by", "of", "the", "a", "an"
       - Check inside ALL HTML tags for untranslated content
       - Verify proper names and locations are culturally adapted when appropriate
       - Ensure numbers, dates, and technical terms follow target language conventions
       - Replace ANY English words found with proper translations
    10. SPECIFIC LANGUAGE CHECKS for each languages {language_list}, here you have an example for few languages:
        - French: Ensure proper accents (é, è, à, ç), check for "le/la/les" articles, verify subjunctive usage
        - Portuguese: Check for proper Portuguese accents (ã, ç, ê), verify Brazilian vs European variants
        - Arabic: Ensure proper RTL formatting, check for correct Arabic script, verify cultural appropriateness
    11. Ensure that each translation maintains the tone of voice {ton_of_voice} and brand personality.
    12. Proofread each version to eliminate spelling, grammar, or clarity issues. Final output must be publication-ready.
    13. For RTL (right-to-left) languages like Arabic or Hebrew, wrap the content in a <div dir="rtl"> ... </div>.
    14. FINAL VALIDATION: Before submitting, re-read the entire translation to catch any remaining English words or awkward phrasing.

  expected_output: >
    XML structured like this one, ready to be parsed with nothing else, do not forget the CDATA for the title and body.
    CRITICAL: The title in each <title> tag MUST be the exact translation of the title that appears after "### **Final Post Title**" in the Brand Voice & Style Specialist output.
